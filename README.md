# embedfile package for LaTeX

## Version: 2023-01-12 v2.12

This package embeds files in a PDF document, using the PDF format's embedding 
operation (note the contrast with the attach operation used by the attachfile 
and attachfile2 packages). Currently only pdfTeX and luaTeX in PDF mode are
supported.
